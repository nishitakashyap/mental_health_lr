#  Mental Health Treatment Prediction

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a person is likely to seek treatment for mental health issues, based on survey data.


## Project Overview

- Dataset: Mental health survey responses (cleaned and encoded)
- Goal: Predict `treatment` (yes/no) using personal and workplace features
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall


## Tools Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn


## Visualizations

- Countplot of treatment status
- Correlation heatmap
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
- Feature importance

## Files in this repo

- `Mental Health.ipynb`: Complete notebook with EDA, preprocessing, training & evaluation
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now!

##  How to Run

1. Open `Mental Health.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
2. Run all cells step-by-step
3. View output graphs and model predictions
